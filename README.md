# Breast Cancer Classification Model - Selecting the best performing model

## Description

This is a comparision of three breast cancer classification models which are designed to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing breast masses as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). Leveraging machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forrest, these models analyze features extracted from fine needle aspirate (FNA) images to make predictions. Through extensive training and hyperparameter tuning, the models achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors. By providing accurate and timely predictions, the best performing model aims to improve early detection of breast cancer, leading to better patient outcomes and more effective treatment strategies.

## Results

Below models achieves the following performance metrics on unseen test data:

- Logistic Regression: Accuracy = 94%, Precision = 94%, Recall = 94%, F1-score = 94%
- Support Vector Machine: Accuracy = 96%, Precision = 96%, Recall = 96%, F1-score = 96%
- Random Forest: Accuracy = 92%, Precision = 93%, Recall = 92%, F1-score = 92%

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Support Vector Machine model in accurately classifying breast masses, providing valuable support to healthcare professionals in diagnosis and treatment planning.
